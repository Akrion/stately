#Stately
Stately is a symbol font that makes is easy to create a map of the United States using only HTML and CSS. Each state can be styled independently with CSS for making simple visualizations. And since it's a font, it scales bigger and smaller while staying sharp as a tack on retina displays.

##What is Stately?
Each state is a glyph within the font. Each state is positioned and sized relative to the the rest of the states, so that when each character is stacked on top of one another, it creates a full map.
The pertinent characters are uppercase A-Z and lowercase a-z with lowercase y generating the District of Columbia and lowercase z generating a full US map.
For modern browsers ligatures are available and a state's abbreviation is it's ligature. For example, "va" generates the glyph of the state of Virginia and 'dc' the District of Columbia. Additionally, the ligature "usa" produces a character of the full US map.

##Basic Use Case

Download and add the Stately folder to your project which includes the base CSS and the web font files. Grab the stately folder and add it to your project. Then add the stately.css to the head of your document.
